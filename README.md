# pyOpenSci Package Template

> A Python package template that supports the pyOpenSci
> pure [Python packaging tutorial](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/intro.html).
This template can be used with [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) to initialize a
new Python package project structure following the practices outlined in the pyOpenSci
tutorial.

## How to use this template

To begin install copier. You can either use pipx to install copier globally if you are a pipx user or you can install it into a local Python envirnment using pip.

Local installation:

`pip install copier`

Global installation:

`pipx install copier`

## Run the template workflow

Once you have installed copier, you are ready to create your Python package template. 
First, cun the command below from your favorite shell. Note that this is copying our template from GitHub so it 
will require internet access to run properly.

The command below will create the package directory in your current working directory. 

`copier copy gh:pyopensci/pyos-package-template . `

If you wish to create the package directory in another directory you can specify it like this:

`copier copy gh:pyopensci/pyos-package-template dirname-here`

## Template overview
The copier template will ask you a series of questions which you can respond to. The questions will 
help you customize the template. 

Below is what the template workflow will look like when you run it. In the example below, you  
"fully customize" the template.  


```console
